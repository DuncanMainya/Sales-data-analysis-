# Retail Sales Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using Python-based tools. The goal is to uncover sales trends, seasonal patterns, top-performing products, and other business insights through data analysis — without involving machine learning or SQL.



##  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – for creating static data visualizations



##  Project Objectives

- Analyze monthly and yearly sales trends
- Identify seasonality in customer purchasing behavior
- Determine top-selling products over time
- Provide insights on sales growth and performance patterns

Key Findings

- Sales Trends: Clear monthly and yearly growth patterns were observed.
- Seasonality: Sales peaked during specific months, indicating strong seasonal behavior.
- Top Products: A small subset of products accounted for a large portion of total sales.

---

Limitations

- This analysis does not include SQL or database queries (yet).
- Assumes clean, structured sales data in CSV format.
- Does not incorporate customer demographics or external factors like promotions.

 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DuncanMainya/Sales-data-analysis-.git
   cd sales-data-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Jupyter/Colab notebook or check the exported report in `/report`.


Future Work
 Add SQL queries for deeper analysis.
 Integrate dashboards using tools like Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit.
 Expand analysis to include customer segmentation and regional sales breakdown.
